- 👋 Hi, I’m @GilbertRPG
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about how to use GitHub and coding in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of coding from DK's "Beginner's Step-By-Step Coding Course" and debating on going to college for machine learning/robotics design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Factorio mods!
- 📫 How to reach me? Gmail: yannirocco@gmail.com
